## ParkLet
> "Airbnb for parking"
This is my final year project for Dublin City University,  Computer Applications 2019 achieving a final mark of 81%.
Parklet is an Android app written in Java, using the MVVM design pattern, Firebase Realtime Database, Firebase Cloud Functions and NFC write/read functionality.

### Outline

The project is an android based app which utilizes firebase for the back-end as well as real time synchronization to the database.
Uses the google maps api for locating available parking for the customer and an nfc check in/check out system
for a clean way for users to notify each other on their arrival/departure. 
This NFC system also allows the home owner to know whether the customer has left on time or not.
