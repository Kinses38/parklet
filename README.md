> "Airbnb for parking"

The aim of our project will be to develop an android app that will allow 
homeowners to easily rent out their driveways as parking spaces to commuters 
with minimal effort. And likewise enable commuters to easily view and book 
parking spots with competitive rates.

### Outline

The project will be an android based app which will utilize firebase for our back-end as well as real time synchronization to our database.
We plan on using the google maps api for locating available parking for the customer. We also hope to implement a nfc check in/check out system
for a clean way for users to notify each other on their arrival/departure. This nfc system will also allow the home owner to know whether the
customer has left on time or not.

### Background

> Where did the ideas come from?

We were searching for ideas that could fit the AirBnB model of owning and renting a good or service, due to living in Dublin 
we are well aware of the problems that commuting causes. With limited parking available in large areas of Dublin and the lack
of use of most parking spots such as drive-ways during work hours, we thought this would be a great solution while also being
a useful passive income for the parking spot owners.
