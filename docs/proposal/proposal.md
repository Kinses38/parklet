## SECTION B

### Introduction

The aim of our project will be to develop an android app that will allow 
home owners to easily rent out their driveways as parking spaces to commuters 
with minimal effort. And likewise enable commuters to easily view and book 
parking spots with competitive rates.

### Outline

> Outline the proposed project.

### Background

> Where did the ideas come from?

### Achievements

> What functions will the project provide? Who will the users be?

**Users:**
- Daily commuters in congested areas with limited parking available, offering them an alternative parking solution. Whether its a cheaper alternative or to allow closer access than normal car parking services offer.
- Holiday makers looking for cheaper alternatives to airport parking in the case of weekly or monthly parking rental.
- Events like Slane or the Skerries 100 put a massive strain on local car parking services. Festival goers could book a car parking space outside of the festival grounds to avoid the panic of trying to secure a spot and the congestion that follows trying to leave the venue car park.
- Homeowners with available car parking space on their driveway. They might be homeowners who do not drive, commute elsewhere during the day or just have the extra space to facilitate more cars. This app will give them the ability to generate extra income with minimal effort.


### Justification

> Why/when/where/how will it be useful?

### Programming language(s)

- Java

### Programming tools / Tech stack

- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio): Our main IDE for this project.
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database/): Realtime database allowing us to query and sync information in 
  real time.
- [Google maps api](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/): Leveraging google maps api will allow us to implement the geographical aspect of our app.
- [NFC technology](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/nfc): To allow us to implement the hassle free check-in system.
- [Android-Geofire](https://github.com/firebase/geofire-android): library that allows 
  realtime queries of services based on their geographical location.
- [Espresso](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso): Testing framework allowing us to run automated ui tests.


### Hardware

- Android phone capable of running minimum Android Oreo (8.0) with nfc reader.
- Compatible NFC tags

### Learning Challenges

**Common**
- Android developmemt
- Android studio
- Firebase
- Implementing NFC based technology

**Shaun**
- Previous projects & internship experience utilized functional paradigm 
  languages such as Clojure and Clojurescript. I've never undertaken an Object 
  Oriented project of this size. 

**Mike**
- Using google maps api

### Breakdown of work

> Clearly identify who will undertake which parts of the project.
>
> It must be clear from the explanation of this breakdown of work both that each student is responsible for
> separate, clearly-defined tasks, and that those responsibilities substantially cover all of the work required
> for the project.

- Implementation of the base Android UI
- Implementation of the map functionality 
- Implementation of NFC enabled check-in
- Firebase functionality 
- Implementation of User profiles (Home owner and Customer)
